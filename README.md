# demos
A suite of FE pages for demonstrating some of the functionality of Onaji's search and recommendation APIs.

### Recommender ([link](https://github.com/onaji-io/demos/tree/main/src/demos/recommender))
`/demo/recommender`
[online demo](https://demos.onaji.io/demo/recommender)
### Trait Search (coming soon)
`/demo/trait-search`
### Visual Search (coming soon)
`/demo/visual-search`

Each of these demos comes with a very simple UI to show how easy it is to integrate Onaji's APIs into an existing frontend.

## Setup
These demos are built using React and ChakraUI, and can be run using react scripts. 

```
1. git clone && cd demos
2. npm install
3. npm run start
```

Please note that currently, you will be unable to request data from Onaji's APIs from localhost. It is better to experiment with the live demos at:
